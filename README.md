### Saving Picture to Library

Every time user press the button to save the picture, UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum will be triggered. This function gonna save the random generated picture to local photo library, and user can use it as background for their Iphone or share on social media platforms. After user pressed the saving button the title of the button will be changed, which notice the user the picture has been saved to library. Also the button will be disable at the same time when button title changed. It will prevent user to save duplicated picture to their library. Whenever the view reloaded or random picture generated again, the button will switch to enable.
